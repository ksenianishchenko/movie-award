    <p className="main-text"><strong>"Oscar"</strong> - the award of the American Academy of cinema - is undoubtedly the most famous and popular in the world of cinema award. The first award ceremony "Oscar" was held in 1929. Now the Oscars ceremony is broadcast live in dozens of countries around the world. Brands of clothing worn by the stars at the ceremony, instantly become very prestigious. Unlike most film festivals, "Oscars" are awarded by the results of a General vote of the Academy members, and not by the choice of the jury. And such a democracy has brought this film a well-deserved popularity, though deprived of elitism.</p>
